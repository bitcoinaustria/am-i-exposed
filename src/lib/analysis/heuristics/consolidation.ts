/**
 * Consolidation and Batching Pattern Detection
 *
 * Identifies structural transaction patterns beyond what CIOH covers:
 *
 * 1. Fan-in (consolidation): Many inputs to 1 output. Reveals the full
 *    UTXO set controlled by a single entity. Combined with CIOH, this
 *    is the strongest possible ownership signal.
 *
 * 2. Fan-out (batching): 1 input to many outputs. Common in exchange
 *    batch withdrawals. Informational - reveals entity payment patterns.
 *
 * 3. Cross-type consolidation: Consolidation that combines UTXOs from
 *    different script types (e.g., P2PKH + P2WPKH). Links addresses
 *    from different wallet generations together.
 *
 * Severity scales with input count:
 *   3-5 inputs = medium, 6-10 = high, 10+ = critical
 *
 * Impact is kept modest since CIOH already penalizes multi-input txs.
 * The value here is the pattern label and cross-type detection.
