 * H10: Address Type Analysis
 *
 * P2TR (Taproot) hides script complexity - single-sig, multisig, and
 * timelocks all look identical. Ideal for multisig/contracts.
 * P2WPKH (native SegWit) has the largest anonymity set - excellent for
 * single-sig. P2SH and P2PKH are worse for privacy.

 * Impact: -5 to +5
